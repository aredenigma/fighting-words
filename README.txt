This is a bit of processing code that traces waveforms of audio files and exports them to PDF vector art. You can then edit the lines in CAD software to generate 3D forms for fabrication. 

Two sample audio files are included. 

Make sure you change the font to something available on your system. 

This was created for Interactive Art & Computational Design, Spring 2013, @ Carnegie Mellon University.
